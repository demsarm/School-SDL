# The repo where I keep the code I write when learning SDL

The code is super garbage and unpotimized, not to mention the lack of comments cobmined with my style of coding probably makes it completely unreadable but I don't really care because the it probably won't ever be used in an actual project since it'll be easier to start anew than getting this trainwreck to work.
